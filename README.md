# Zoom Meeting Playback with Hidden YouTube Video Integration

## Project Overview
This is a fun and practical project designed to help users enjoy a quick break during office hours while staying under the radar of supervisors or CCTV cameras. The website integrates a Zoom meeting playback interface with hidden YouTube video playback functionality. Users can input any YouTube video into an Audio Transcript box, hit enter, and the Zoom video interface will display and play that video. The interface also includes a simulated sidebar with voice transcripts, creating a realistic Zoom meeting experience.
